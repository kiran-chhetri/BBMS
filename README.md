# Blood Bank Management System (BBMS)

The Blood Bank Management System is a web-based application designed to automate and streamline the operations of a blood bank. Blood banks are critical components of healthcare infrastructure, and their efficient management is vital for saving lives. Manual management of blood bank operations is prone to errors, inefficiencies, and delays that can have life-threatening consequences. 

This project aims to develop a comprehensive web-based platform to automate donor registration, recipient management, blood stock tracking, eligibility verification, and blood request processing. 

## Features
- **Donor Management**: Register donors, track donations, and manage deferrals.
- **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time tracking of blood units and components with expiration alerts.
- **Patient & Transfusion**: Manage patient requests and handle the crossmatching process.
- **Lab Screening**: Screen donations for safety before component separation.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure sections tailored to different staff roles (Booth, Lab, Inventory, Transfusion, Admin).
- **Dashboard & Analytics**: Real-time system counters and visual statistics.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript (Chart.js, TomSelect)

## Local Development Setup
